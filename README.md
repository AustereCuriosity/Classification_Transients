# Classification of Periodic Variables using Machine Learning techniques on Light Curve Data

During the period of January 2017 - June 2017, I worked under the supervision of Dr. Sheelu Abraham, Postdoctoral Fellow at the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune. This code is a preliminary version of the classification performed.
